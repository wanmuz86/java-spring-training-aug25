// A class is the representation of the real world object [ A person, A human]
// in Object Oriented Programming
// Eg - A hotel, A room, An Attraction, A Facility, A Landmark

public class Person {
	
	// properties - what describe a class
	
	private String name;
	private int age;
	

}

//Encapsulation in OOP means keeping an object's data (properties) private 
//and restricting direct access to them. 
//Access is provided through public methods (getters and setters) 
//to control how the data is read or modified.
